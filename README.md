# Toxic Comments Classification 

This project is part of National University of Singapore's (NUS) CS3244 Machine Learning module. The project topic was chosen from Kaggle, where it was originally hosted as a competition. 

The project aims to identify and distinguish toxic Wikipedia comments from clean ones. Also, it aims to classify such comments according to the different levels of toxicity through the use of various models - ranging from traditional supervised models such as logistic regression, to modern approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNN).
